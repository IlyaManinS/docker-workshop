<h3>Question 3</h3>

SELECT COUNT(*)  
FROM public.green_taxi_trips  
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime BETWEEN '2025-11-01 00:00:00' AND '2025-11-30 23:59:59'  
AND trip_distance <= 1  

Answer: 8007

<h3> Question 4 </h3>

-- using a CTE (can be done with the subqueries as well) in case there are multiple days with the same trip distance

WITH ranked_days AS  
(  
SELECT DATE(lpep_pickup_datetime) as date_pickup, MAX(trip_distance) as max_distance,  
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY MAX(trip_distance) DESC) as trip_rank  
FROM public.green_taxi_trips  
GROUP BY date_pickup HAVING MAX(trip_distance) < 100  
)  
SELECT date_pickup, max_distance  
FROM ranked_days   
WHERE trip_rank = 1  

Answer: 2025-11-14

<h3> Question 5 </h3>

-- again, using a CTE in case there are multiple zones with the same total

WITH ranked_zones AS  
(  
SELECT "Zone", ROUND(SUM(total_amount)::numeric,2) as zone_total,  
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(total_amount) DESC) as zone_rank  
FROM public.green_taxi_trips t  
INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones z  
ON t."PULocationID" = z."LocationID"  
GROUP BY "Zone"  
)  
SELECT "Zone", zone_total  
FROM ranked_zones  
WHERE zone_rank = 1  


Answer: East Harlem North


<h3> Question 6 </h3>

-- this is the most "readable" version where we don't know the ID of the east harlem north zone.   
-- you can run in a separate query to get the name of the location and have one CTE with PULocationID = {id}  
-- again, using a CTE in case there are multiple zones with the same maximum tip  


WITH east_harlem_north_trips AS  
(  
SELECT t.*  
FROM public.green_taxi_trips t  
INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones z  
ON t."PULocationID" = z."LocationID"  
WHERE "Zone" = 'East Harlem North'  
)  
, ranked_drop_offs AS  
(  
SELECT "Zone", MAX(tip_amount) as max_amount,  
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY MAX(tip_amount) DESC) as zone_rank  
FROM east_harlem_north_trips t  
INNER JOIN public.taxi_zones z  
ON t."DOLocationID" = z."LocationID"  
GROUP BY "Zone"  
)  
SELECT "Zone", max_amount  
FROM ranked_drop_offs r  
WHERE zone_rank = 1
